public fun issue_certificate(
    institution: &Institution,
    credential_title: String,
    holder_address: address,
    achievement_data: LinkedTable<String, String>,
    ctx: &mut TxContext
)
```

### Managing Learning Paths
```move
// Create a new learning path
public fun create_learning_path(
    name: String,
    description: String,
    required_credentials: vector<String>,
    completion_reward: u64,
    ctx: &mut TxContext
)
```
